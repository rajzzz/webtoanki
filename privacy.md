Last updated: [July 25, 2025]

Web To Anki is a browser extension designed to help users create flashcards from websites and documents. We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and what your rights are.

## What We Collect

- **Local settings** (stored via `chrome.storage.local`) such as:
  - API keys you manually enter (e.g., for Pro features)
  - Extension preferences
  - UI settings

- **Highlight or page content** you manually select, only when you interact with the extension (not automatically)

- **Optional usage stats** (if enabled by the user) to help improve the tool

We **do not** track your browsing history or collect background data.

## How It's Used

- Your selected content is sent to a backend or language model **only when you explicitly request flashcard generation**
- API keys you enter are used only to access LLM services and are **never shared or logged**
- We never sell or share your data with third parties

## Third-Party Services

If you use Pro features, requests may go to:

- Gemini / OpenAI APIs (your key, your quota)
- Our backend (for secure routing to LLMs or Pro-only features)

## Data Control

- You can delete all extension data at any time via your browserâ€™s extension settings
- We do not persist or store personal data on our servers unless explicitly required (e.g. Pro activation)

## Contact
